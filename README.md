# RNN_Stock_Price_Prediction
The objective of this assignment is to try and predict the stock prices using historical data from four companies: IBM (IBM), Google (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT). We use four different companies because they belong to the same sector: Technology. Using data from all four companies may improve the performance of the model.
